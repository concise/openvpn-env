0.  Install VirtualBox and Vagrant.


1.  Make sure your computer (which hosts VMs) connects to the Internet.


2.  Open two terminals, one for the client (run `cd openvpn-client`) and the
    other for the server (run `cd openvpn-server`).


3.  Run `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` in each of the terminal.
    Change to the root shell using `sudo su -`.
    Have terminal multiplexing with `tmux`.


4.  Run openvpn server.

    1)  Each time the system boots up, I should run the command once.
        The server has to NAT the VPN client traffic to the Internet.

        # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

        You can check if it is already set up with the command:

        # iptables -t nat -nL

    2)  Start the server.

        # openvpn --config /root/data/server.conf


5.  Run openvpn client.

    1)  Start the client.

        # openvpn --config /root/data/client.conf

    2)  If needed, remove incorrect routing rules, e.g.,
        run the command `route del -host 192.168.8.8`
        because traffic to vpn server `192.168.8.8`
        should be routed to `eth1` instead of `eth0`.

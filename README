0.  Make sure you have installed VirtualBox and Vagrant.
    Make sure your computer (which hosts VMs) connects to the Internet.


1.  Open two terminals, one for the server:

        --- IN TERMINAL #1 ---
        $ cd server
        $ vagrant up
        $ vagrant ssh

    and the other for the client:

        --- IN TERMINAL #2 ---
        $ cd client
        $ vagrant up
        $ vagrant ssh

    The command `vagrant up` is to boot and set up the VM.
    The command `vagrant ssh` is to get a root shell of the VM.


2.  Run openvpn server.

    Also note that each time the system boots up, I should run the `iptables`
    command once, because the server has to NAT the VPN client traffic to the
    Internet.

        --- IN TERMINAL #1 ---
        # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
        # openvpn --config /root/data/server.conf


3.  Run openvpn client.

        --- IN TERMINAL #2 ---
        # openvpn --config /root/data/client.conf

    Now you should be able to test if the VPN works using packet sniffing tools
    like `tcpdump`.

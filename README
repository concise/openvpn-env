0.  Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

1.  Make sure your computer (which hosts VMs) connects to the Internet

2.  Open two terminals, one for the client (run `cd openvpn-client`) and the
    other for the server (run `cd openvpn-server`)

3.  Run `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` in each of the terminal

4.  Run openvpn server in the shell

    # /root/local/bin/openvpn --config \
      /root/openvpn-master/sample/sample-config-files/server.conf

5.  Run openvpn client in the shell

    # /root/local/bin/openvpn --config \
      /root/openvpn-master/sample/sample-config-files/client.conf

    Remove incorrect routing rules if needed (e.g., traffic to vpn server
    should be routed to `eth1`, not `eth0`)

    # route del -host 192.168.8.8
